                           COSE Hash Envelope
                  draft-ietf-cose-hash-envelope-latest

Abstract

   This document defines new COSE header parameters for signaling a
   payload as an output of a hash function.  This mechanism enables
   faster validation as access to the original payload is not required
   for signature validation.  Additionally, hints of the detached
   payload's content format and availability are defined providing
   references to optional discovery mechanisms that can help to find
   original payload content.

1.  Introduction

   COSE defined detached payloads in Section 2 of [RFC9052], using nil
   as the payload.  In order to verify a signature over a cose-sign1,
   the signature checker requires access to the payload content.  Hashes
   are already used on a regular basis as identifiers for payload data,
   such as documents or software components.  As hashes typically are
   smaller than the payload data they represent, they are simpler to
   transport.  Additional hints in the protected header ensure
   cryptographic agility for the hashing and signing algorithms.  Hashes
   and other identifiers are commonly used as hints to discover and
   distinguish resources.  Using a hash as an identifier for a resource
   has the advantage of enabling integrity checking.  In some
   applications, such as remote signing procedures, conveyance of hashes
   instead original payload content reduce transmission time and costs.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms COSE, CDDL, and EDN are defined in [RFC9052], [RFC8610],
   [I-D.draft-ietf-cbor-edn-literals] respectively.

3.  Header Parameters

   This document specifies the following new header parameters commonly
   used alongside hashes to identify resources:

   TBD_1:  the hash algorithm used to produce the payload.

   TBD_2:  the content type of the bytes that were hashed (preimage) to
      produce the payload, given as a content-format number
      (Section 12.3 of [RFC7252]) or as a media-type name optionally
      with parameters (Section 8.3 of [RFC9110]).

   TBD_3:  an identifier enabling retrieval of the original resource
      (preimage) identified by the payload.

4.  Hash Envelope CDDL

   Hash_Envelope_Protected_Header = {
       ? &(alg: 1) => int,
       &(payload_hash_alg: TBD_1) => int
       &(payload_preimage_content_type: TBD_2) => uint / tstr
       ? &(payload_location: TBD_3) => tstr
       * int / tstr => any
   }

   Hash_Envelope_Unprotected_Header = {
       * int / tstr => any
   }

   Hash_Envelope_as_COSE_Sign1 = [
       protected : bstr .cbor Hash_Envelope_Protected_Header,
       unprotected : Hash_Envelope_Unprotected_Header,
       payload: bstr / nil,
       signature : bstr
   ]

   Hash_Envelope = #6.18(Hash_Envelope_as_COSE_Sign1)

   *  Label 1 (alg) Cryptographic algorithm to use

   *  Label TBD_1 (payload hash alg) MUST be present in the protected
      header and MUST NOT be present in the unprotected header.

   *  Label TBD_2 (content type of the preimage of the payload) MAY be
      present in the protected header or unprotected header.

   *  Label TBD_3 (payload_location) MAY be added to the protected
      header and MUST NOT be presented in the unprotected header.

   *  Label 3 (content_type) MUST NOT be present in the protected or
      unprotected headers.

   Label 3 is easily confused with label TBD_2
   payload_preimage_content_type.  The difference between content_type
   (3) and payload_preimage_content_type (TBD2) is content_type is used
   to identify the content format associated with payload, whereas
   payload_preimage_content_type is used to identify the content format
   of the bytes which are hashed to produce the payload.

   Profiles that rely on this specification MAY choose to mark TBD_1,
   TBD_2, TBD_3 (or other header parameters) critical, see
   Appendix C.1.3 of [RFC9052] for more details.

5.  Envelope EDN

   The following informative example demonstrates how to construct a
   hash envelope for a resource already commonly referenced by its hash.

   18([ # cose-sign1
     <<{
       / signature alg   / 1: -35, # ES384
       / key identifier  / 4: h'75726e3a...32636573',
       / cose sign1 type / 16: "application/example+cose",
       / hash algorithm  / TBD_1: -16, # sha256
       / media type      / TBD_2: "application/spdx+json",
       / location        /
            TBD_3: "https://sbom.example/.../manifest.spdx.json"
     }>>
     / unprotected / {},
     / payload     / h'935b5a91...e18a588a',
            # As seen in manifest.spdx.json.sha256
     / signature   / h'15280897...93ef39e5'
            # ECDSA Signature with SHA 384 and P-384
   ])

   In this example, an SPDX software bill of materials (SBOM) in JSON
   format is already commonly identified by its SHA256 hash.  For
   example, some tooling generates a file, such as
   manifest.spdx.json.sha256, which contains the SHA256 hash of the
   corresponding manifest.spdx.json file.

   The content type for manifest.spdx.json is already well known as
   application/spdx+json, and is registered with IANA
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/spdx+json).

   The full JSON SBOM is available at a URL, such as
   https://sbom.example/.../manifest.spdx.json.

   The payload of this COSE_Sign1 is the SHA256 hash of the
   manifest.spdx.json, which is typically found in an adjacent file
   (manifest.spdx.json.sha256).

   The type of this COSE_Sign1 is application/example+cose, but other
   types may be used to establish more specific media types for
   signatures of hashes.

   The signature is produced using ES384 which means using ECDSA with
   SHA384 hash function and P-384 elliptic curve.

   This example is chosen to highlight that an existing system may use a
   hash algorithm such as sha256.  This hash becomes the payload of a
   COSE-Sign1.  When signed with a signature algorithm that is
   parameterized via a hash function, such as ECDSA with SHA384, the to
   be signed structure as described in Section 4.4 of RFC9052.

   The resulting signature is computed over the protected header and
   payload, providing integrity and authenticity for the hash algorithm,
   content type and location of the associated resource, in this case a
   software bill of materials.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Choice of Hash Function

   It is RECOMMENDED to align the strength of the chosen hash function
   to the strength of the chosen signature algorithm.  For example, when
   signing with ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256, use SHA-256 to hash the
   payload.  Note that when using a pre-hash algorithm, the algorithm
   SHOULD be registered in the IANA COSE Algorithms registry, and should
   be distinguishable from non-pre hash variants that may also be
   present.  The approach this specification takes is just one way to
   perform application agnostic pre-hashing, meaning the pre hashing is
   not done with binding or consideration for a specific application
   context, while preforming application (cose) specific signing,
   meaning the to be signed bytes include the cose structures necessary
   to distinguish a cose signature from other digital signature formats.

6.2.  Encrypted Hashes

   When present in COSE_Encrypt, the header parameters registered in
   this document leak information about the ciphertext.  These
   parameters SHOULD NOT be present in COSE_Encrypt headers unless this
   disclosure is acceptable.

   When present in a protected header, the semantics are the same as for
   a COSE_Sign1: decrypted payload is expected to be the output of the
   hash function specified in the protected header.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  COSE Header Parameters

   IANA is requested to add the COSE header parameters defined in
   Section 3, as listed in Table 1, to the "COSE Header Parameters"
   registry [IANA.cose_header-parameters], in the 'Integer values from
   256 to 65535' range ('Specification Required' Registration
   Procedure).

Appendix A.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section as well as references
   to [BCP205] before AUTH48.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [BCP205].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [BCP205], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
