Unfortunately, COSE was authored in such a way that indirect identification of content is considered an application layer concept and not a core concept within COSE explicitly.\r\n\r\nGiven the only way to validate a COSE message is to provide the content as part of the verification structure, we're left with needing application layer logic to manage expectations of indirect identification.  If we need application layer logic, then I'm not quite seeing how moving everything but the hash value into COSE protected headers solve this problem differently vrs using a `COSE_Hash_V` structure as the COSE message content for indirect identification of content and processing it as such via content-type of COSE_Hash_V identification.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that there is another problem that moving fields into the COSE protected header is intended to solve, which may not have been fully articulated yet, beyond integrity protection?",

          "body": "I'm guessing the issue lies in the use of \"detached\" vrs indirect.\r\n\r\nWhen working with this in the past, it was found that a COSE Sign 1 cannot be validated without access to what COSE calls the payload in bstr form.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at RFC 9052: CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE): Structures and Process (rfc-editor.org)<https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052#name-signing-and-verification-pr>, specifically 4.4's Sig_structure:\r\n\r\nSig_structure = [\r\n    context : \"Signature\" / \"Signature1\",\r\n    body_protected : empty_or_serialized_map,\r\n    ? sign_protected : empty_or_serialized_map,\r\n    external_aad : bstr,\r\n    payload : bstr\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs I understand it and have experienced thus far, the COSE payload must always be provided to perform verification (even in a detached COSE message). Without the payload, the COSE message cannot be verified and/or processed. This means that anything wanting to process a COSE message must always have access to the payload which was used to generate the COSE message. The issue with SCITT, along with other verifier scenarios, is they want to be able to verify the COSE message (and read headers etc) without needing access to the payload.  However to validate that COSE message hasn't been tampered with, they still must process a payload to satisfy the Sig_structure.\r\n\r\nUnless I am missing something major, it doesn't seem possible for a verifier to allow a detached COSE signature without the payload also being accessible. In the case where the hash is the COSE payload, an embedded COSE signature makes far more sense given the complexity of managing and dealing with the various pieces of a detached COSE signature for such a small payload provides little value.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I'm not sure there is a ton of value for a detached COSE signature to be used in the verifier use case of hashes. Once a verifier needs to support a detached COSE signature, they then must support the entity posting the COSE message to it, to also provide the payload and the choice of how large that payload can/should be is a function of the verifiers policy.\r\n\r\nI think the confusion may be stemming from the use of \"detached payloads\" which I'm interpreting as \"detached COSE signatures\" where it's quite possible others may be interpreting it as \"indirect content identification\".\r\n\r\nMy summary is as follows:\r\n\r\n  1.  COSE Verifiers must ALWAYS have access to COSE payloads either by only supporting embedded content, or detached COSE signature with associated payloads provided.\r\n  2.\r\nThose payloads provided for COSE verification could either be the raw content (of whatever size limits imposed by the verifier), or a hash of content, but that payload must still be provided to the verifier.\r\n\r\nI'm just not sure how one handles trying to support detached payloads as a verifier and still not want access to payloads. Access to payloads is simply a requirement of COSE.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Orie Steele ***@***.***>\r\nSent: Friday, January 12, 2024 12:59 PM\r\nTo: OR13/draft-steele-cose-hash-envelope ***@***.***>\r\nCc: Comment ***@***.***>\r\nSubject: Re: [OR13/draft-steele-cose-hash-envelope] Use `COSE_Hash_V` (Issue #9)\r\n\r\n\r\nA hash of content is just another app layer concern.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/cose-wg/draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs\r\n\r\nWe have COSE Sign 1 payload that are merkle tree roots for a specific type of application cose sign 1 called a \"receipt\".\r\n\r\nWe discover the semantics necessary to process this payload, from the protected headers.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken here is essentially the same, except it is for \"signed statements\"\r\n\r\n( these terms, \"signed statements, and receipts\" come from SCITT, see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture-04#section-5 )\r\n\r\nThe reason it is desirable to have a signed hash and meta data, that is also a COSE Sign 1, is that a Verifier will have a policy that says:\r\n\r\n  1.

          "body": "I agree with Jeromy that, in the context of indirect signatures where the payload is a hash, it's confusing to discuss detached payloads. A primary benefit of an indirect signature is that a hash is small, so a verifier does not need access to a potentially large payload to verify the envelope's signature. Detached payloads are of course \"allowed\" and can be supported if the hash/payload is provided to a verifier out of band, but I don't see a strong use case.\r\n\r\nI also agree that it seems more straightforward to use the `COSE_Hash_V` structure as the payload, rather than in a new header (especially because the latter implies duplication of the hash bstr as both the payload and a required field in the header value). With this approach, the existing `content type: 3` header could be used to accurately describe the payload content as a `COSE_Hash_V` structure, and the application can process it accordingly. I'm not sure that the new `typ` header describing the type of the envelope is even necessary in this scenario.\r\n\r\nI actually think there's an opportunity to avoid needing to register any new header parameters at all, leveraging `content type`. Rather than using the new `payload_preimage_content_type` header parameter, we could register a `+cose-hash-v` media type suffix. This would concisely signal to an application that the payload is a `COSE_Hash_V` structure representing a preimage of the specified type, e.g. `application/json+cose-hash-v`, while requiring no special handling of the envelope or new semantics. It's also consistent with the principle Jeromy highlighted, that indirection is an application layer concept.\r\n\r\nAre there scenarios that this approach would be incompatible with?",

This draft states the `content type` of the payload is a hash. \r\nThe TBD_2 pre-image content type (`applicatoin/json`) provides the formatting of the content of the un-hashed payload.\r\nWe also now have 16 typ ([RFC9596](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9596/), which would have something equivalent to `application/hashed+cose`\r\nWhen using hash payload, what values should/must be populated:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  / alg : ES384 / 1: -35,\r\n  / kid / 4: h'75726e3a...32636573',\r\n  / typ / 16: application/hashed+cose\r\n  / payload_preimage_content_type / TBD_2: application/jwk+json\r\n  / content-type / 3: applicatoin/hashed+cose\r\n  / payload_hash_alg sha-256 / TBD_1: 1\r\n  / payload_location / TBD_3 : storage.example/244f...9c19\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Since 3/content-type is optional, should 3 not be specified, as it's essentially duplicated by 16 + TBD_1\r\n- Should 3 be equal to /typ / 16: application/hashed+cose\r\n\r\nThe draft should specify the behavior, in the informative section at a minimum\r\n",

The arguments put forth in RFC9054 still hold true.\r\n\r\nAnother question that comes to mind is that hashing of content to represent and indirect immutable key for the original content isn't a unique COSE issue. As such might it be possible to consider a content-type extension approach in which the content-type can be augmented with something such as `+hash_sha256` to represent the `.Content` is in-fact a hash of the original content/type without needing any new headers?  Of course, this means we lose some of the application specific fields such as location and others proposed here, but we're left with a generic answer to a generic problem verse a COSE specific implementation.",
